Aug-24,parent,Resource Quality,Such fabulous resources. Just not using as desired because life is too busy. Will keep in mind for future. Great site. Thank you.
Aug-24,ey,Price,I was charged $9 for monthly renewal on 8/10. The renewal should not have auto paid until 8/18 as stated.
Aug-24,ks3,Price,"most of the resources I found were more for elementary and I teach mostly high school. Also, I have such a small budget I can only afford a very few subscriptions and have to make do with very little. "
Aug-24,US Grade 1,Price,It made me laugh that the bot couldn't understand that  because my prescription went from $10 to $530 on Medicare that I am canceling anything that I can.  Too funny!
Aug-24,US Grade 5,Price,"I will be back! Our school had to cut our classroom budgets and personally, inflation is killing me :) Twinkl is amazing but I'm cutting all personal subscriptions for a bit <3... not sure how long it will take for the price of groceries and gas to ease up a bit."
Aug-24,slt,Price,"Please don't make it nearly impossible to find where and how to cancel my membership, that is extremely predatory. "
Aug-24,US Grade 2,Price,"My children are going back to school and I was using this for summer learning. This is an excellent resource, though, and we'll be back next summer!"
Aug-24,ks4,Price,I thought that my subscription was done and everything and I cancel it and I guess not. I’ll try and get a refund for all the subscriptions that been going on.
Aug-24,parent,Price,"Love this site, very useful and helpful. Used it to supplement my son's learning during his summer break. Will be back next summer! Thanks a mil for being awesome! :) "
Aug-24,ey,Resource Quality,I have not used the membership at all since I have had it but you took 9.00 from my account.  Can i get a refund please?
Aug-24,ey,Resource Quality,"Dual language printables with visuals for which are english-mandarin and preschool age appropriate. This is mostly geared for kindergarten and higher,"
Aug-24,US Kindergarten,Resource Quality,"Scholastic Teachables - I like most of their printables better. You cover more subjects, but Twinkl printables feel more like busywork in some ways vs. the printables at Scholastic. I also prefer Scholastic's artwork. The artwork at Twinkl is very vector-ish. ;) Also, a subscription is expensive for me since I'm not actually using the materials. I am scheduling them to my homeschool curriculum and then recommending for my customers to purchase a subscription. I am paying for the subscription so that I can properly preview some of the items before scheduling them. So, I am canceling for now but may come back later. :)"
Aug-24,sen,Resource Quality,The material often says it can be downloaded or used and then errors or there isn't enough material for the subjects I need.
Aug-24,US Grade 2,Resource Quality,I only needed the membership for a summer program. I will potentially get another membership again next summer.
Aug-24,US Grade 4,Resource Quality,"I’m no longer homeschooling as my child was accepted to the school we were waiting on, so membership was no longer needed. Was not dissatisfied with services or products. Would recommend. "
Aug-24,ks1,Variety of Materials,Do you need more modifications and visuals for special ed students? You should use the board maker symbols for PowerPoint otherwise it’s not good for any special lead teachers.
Aug-24,adult educator,Variety of Materials,"I loved using your materials, but I'm teaching a different level of adult classes this year and they are not something I can use for my current classes.  Thank you for the great materials!"
Aug-24,US Grade 8,Customer Service,"I didn’t like being drug through the app numerous times whe Trying to cancel my trial membership. If I get billed in October I’ll let your administration discuss it with my attorney. 

Sincerely,
Donald Lenoir "
Aug-24,US Grade 3,Customer Service,I still haven’t gotten my twinkl planner. Not reliable. So please remove my subscriptions. Thank you.
Aug-24,ey,Ease of Website,"It’s incredibly difficult to access the account after signing up. Not a single email was sent. Not even to my junk folders. Then, the amount of random questions that need to be answered prior to anyone helping is a bit excessive. Going to find something more streamlined and simpler. "
Aug-24,ks1,Ease of Website,I cannot find the resources that I need. This does not fit what I am looking for. Please cancel any and all memberships under my name.
Aug-24,US Grade 5,Ease of Website,"subject posters
handouts
It's just overwhelming. I search for something, then I get 50 packets with 5 things each and I haven't yet found anything useful. I'm sure it's there, it just takes hours to comb through."
Aug-24,ks4,Ease of Website,Career and Employability Skills resources for high school students and resources in the spanish language for new ELL students in that subject
Aug-24,US Grade 3,Variety of Materials,"A lot of things I looked for weren't available. I primarily teach non-denominational Bible study for 1st and 2nd graders and many materials were catholic in material. I also struggled to find specific things I wanted, like a map of plymouth colonies to fill in. Finally, as much as $90/year is a bargain, I don't think I'll use $90 worth of materials in the year. "
Aug-24,esl,Variety of Materials,"I wish that the website allowed me to preview materials before downloading them. If there's a way to do that, it wasn't intuitive. In any case, I need to cancel the membership regardless because I can't afford it right now."
Aug-24,US Kindergarten,Variety of Materials,would like to save my custom resources/saved resources on my account or suspend it. I return to work on Mid October but am strapped for cash so cannot pay now.
Aug-24,sen,Variety of Materials,"This was by far the best site for teaching. However, I have retired from the classroom and won't be needing it as much. "
Aug-24,home ed,Resource Quality,Resources are great. We are just experiencing a financial hardship and are cutting things we don't use on a regular bases
Aug-24,US Grade 2,Price,"I didn't know this account was active and that I was being charged monthly. I haven't used this account the entire time, and am really upset since I just discovered this. I haven't used this email in over 3 years. "
Aug-24,US Pre K,Price,I was asked about a planner and since the planner i was getting funds thing from me no thank you delete delete deleted
Aug-24,esl,Price,I know I tried to cancel this in June before the last day of school and thought I had.   I just saw on my cc bill that I had been charged two months.  I found it hard to navigate the website to cancel just now.
Aug-24,esl,Variety of Materials,"My school implemented a stricter curriculum that I must follow, do not have the time to incorporate outside resources."
Aug-24,ks5,Resource Quality,You do not make it easy to cancel.  I shouldn't have to go to the help page to do something as simple as cancelling your free trial.
Aug-24,US Grade 1,Resource Quality,"Most of the good resources are zip files that you have to download instead of just having access to worksheets that can be printed you have to download zip files for them with tons of sheets in them. I don’t want to download 
Zip files everyday just to get one or two worksheets and I don’t want to download zip files everyday to my computer or my phone."
Aug-24,US Kindergarten,Resource Quality,"The resources are very basic, not adequate for correctly educating a child to my standards. Basic information like the parts of a fish cannot be found yet there is tons of information on other things that don't matter. No proper information on what Christmas actually is, and the list goes on and on. Information is also very skewed and biased. "
Aug-24,parent,Resource Quality,"After downloading one of the social stories there was over 500 images that appeared in my recent album in my gallery, they were all from that download and were just random signs symbols and logos completely unrelated to the story. The website is also busy an confusing. There is way to much to concentrate on one item."
Aug-24,US Grade 8,Resource Quality,"Not enough resources for what I teach (digital art, photography, animation, graphic design), if the resources exist they are very hard to find."
Aug-24,adult educator,Variety of Materials,"I AM CANCELLING MY SUBSCRIPTION BECAUSE I AM USING ANOTHER ACCOUNT. I AM STILL USING THE SERVICE, THOUGHT. THANKS!!!"
Aug-24,sen,Variety of Materials,"I signed up for the free trial to gain access to materials, and I was unable to access those materials even after signing up. I was continually prompted to sign up for the annual membership to access materials that were advertised under the free trial. "
Aug-24,US Grade 2,Variety of Materials,I saw a resource on google from your site. I joined and searched for it and nothing comes up. What a bummer to think something was advertised but not actually available.
Aug-24,US Kindergarten,Variety of Materials,"Looking for English phonics game materials 
Plus interesting English class game that are lunached here "
Aug-24,US Grade 7,Variety of Materials,I’m moving from middle school math to high school math and it looks like your resources stop at 8th grade.
Aug-24,US Pre K,Variety of Materials,"After reading the copywriting policy, It is not what I'm looking for. I compose books, and your materials can't be used."
Aug-24,US Grade 8,Variety of Materials,"When our school can afford a membership, we will probably be back. Right now, we just don't have it. Thank you! "
Aug-24,ks2,Variety of Materials,"All about Mexico PPT says Mexico is in North America. Then, a reading about Cactus says it is in South America. "
Aug-24,US Grade 8,Variety of Materials,"Loved the site; however, I teach not only 8th grade but 12th grade... would love to see your site expand into the upper grades."
Aug-24,US Kindergarten,Price,Hace meses que pensaba que había dejado de pagar esta subscripción y que me había dado de baja y resulta que no
Aug-24,US Kindergarten,Price,I had no idea I had a monthly membership. I’m not sure what I did to activate it but I definitely do not want this membership.
Aug-24,Other,Price,"I'm a Girl Scout Leader & a 4H mom.  I really only need this stuff once a year, and it's just not worth paying for year round. "
Aug-24,ks4,Variety of Materials,I am no longer teaching the course I used this for. I tried to cancel in July and just realized you have still been billing me monthly
Aug-24,US Grade 4,Variety of Materials,I never realized I had a subscription.  I used this site only once to get something and then never again.  I’ve been trying to figure out what this twinkle payment was for and just noticed the email this morning.
Aug-24,US Kindergarten,Variety of Materials,All of the SEL crap.  I really do not think most people understand how horrible it is.  They think its just understanding emotions but its not!  Common core was bad enough. The collective dumbing down of our children. Can no longer be a part of it.   Sorry.  Was the last straw for me.
Aug-24,esl,Variety of Materials,"Switched to higher ed, and the resources are more geared toward K-12.  Twinkl was helpful during my time with that age group though!"
Aug-24,esl,Variety of Materials,My county/state doesn't allow the use of instructional materials outside the program we are using. I wouldn't be able to use any of your great materials.
Aug-24,US Grade 2,Variety of Materials,I lost my teaching job so I need to cancel my $9.00/month subscription.  Please cancel my account and stop taking my monthly payment.  Thank you!  I loved your website.
Aug-24,ks4,Variety of Materials,I purchased for use with grandkids and I am not using the membership like I thought I would. I also need to reduce a lot of my memberships.
Aug-24,US Grade 1,Variety of Materials,"What you guys provide is awesome, I was wondering if you have kind of a ""works cited"" on each activity. Who is making them and how reliable are some of the educational materials/actvities. "
Aug-24,ey,Variety of Materials,"You guys are amazing, and I will be back! I recommend you to everyone. I won't be able to work for a while, so I have to cut all my subscriptions until I am better. Thank you!"
Aug-24,US Grade 8,Customer Service,I already canceled and as I check I'm on the ultimate membership again????? Really??? Not cool. Bye Felicia
Aug-24,ey,Customer Service,I canceled with you guys a long time ago and you guys were still charging me! I would like reimbursement
Aug-24,US Grade 5,Customer Service,"I signed up for a trial membership.  It said I would be notified before I was charged.  I was not notified, but I was charted."
Aug-24,US Grade 5,Customer Service,you should never make the cancel button so hard to find. If I would have come back all chances are gone when you make that difficult. It shows you try to confuse or make things difficult on purpose for the customer. That is a trust break.
Aug-24,sen,Customer Service,"you should not automatically renew a membership just via a download, I already canceled my membership then was charged again"
Aug-24,US Kindergarten,Customer Service,"I tried canceling before, but you still automatically renewed a subscription I thought had been cancelled and continued to charge me for June, July and August!!  Not good!!  You make it very difficult to cancel."
Aug-24,adult educator,Customer Service,"I kept the subscription which only slightly meets my needs because of a few good items, and because I wanted the planner which was mentioned back in May. I still have not received one even though I've written several times about the planner. I was sent a cheap, plastic keychain. Poor customer service and expensive monthly fee for few items at the upper levels (8-12). I would have stayed a customer if I felt like my request was honored. I feel like you promised a carrot before summer to keep people hanging on, then didn't give what you promised. I've spend $27 this summer waiting for the planner and probably only downloaded a few items. Poor decision on my part. "
Aug-24,parent,Ease of Website,I never intended to subscribe in the first place. I would like a refund as I couldn't find how to cancel until I used the chat bot today. If I could have found it I would have cancelled long ago. Seriously unhappy and broke cause I haven't been able to work much this summer.
Aug-24,US Grade 6,Ease of Website,"I tried to cancel several months ago and thought I had, but noticed my card still being charged. Hopefully this time it cancels."
Aug-24,US Grade 3,Ease of Website,"It's like you're trying to hide where I can cancel my membership, which seems a little manipulative. Just let people cancel when they want to cancel."
Aug-24,ks3,Ease of Website,"I did not need it, but you made it so difficult to cancel my opinion of the overall quality changed. "
Aug-24,US Grade 6,Ease of Website,"It is really hard to search on your website. I want to look for resources in Spanish, and it is not user friendly, so I have to try to find tricks and workarounds."
Aug-24,US Pre K,Ease of Website,"I tried to cancel my membership on the date prior to it renewing, but the website told me it was too late to cancel. So now I have another month and there are literally no more resources I need, but I have been charged. Is the date time sensitive? I live in the EST time zone in the US."
Aug-24,US Pre K,Customer Service,"I have REPEATEDLY demanded that you end my subscription/membership...but you kept taking my money...I had to cancel my debit card ending in 4351  because your company refused to cancel me...I am on the verge of pursuing a lawsuit for harassment, or at least, blasting you all over social media for refusing to end my membership...END IT NOW!!!!!!!"
Aug-24,US Grade 4,Ease of Website,Your program keeps membership and makes it impossible to cancel therefore taking advantage of families
Aug-24,US Pre K,Ease of Website,I have found other resources right now that are free. I am trying to spend as little money as possible at this time.
Aug-24,US Grade 3,Price,"I was charged annual fee $98 twice from my bank account.  I forgot to stop free trial since I'm 70 years old and was helping my daughter who is a third grade teacher look for new material she could use in her class.  I forgot to cancel trial period but I know I would never choose an annual membership, monthly subscription only cause I'm on fixed income.
I used website once for free posters and I did get planner.  Could you please give me back the $196 that was taken from my bank account.  That amount has caused me problems paying my bills.  Thank you.  If I was a 30 yr old teacher I would  definitely  subscribe but that time in my life has past.  I'm sorry for any problems I have caused you."
Aug-24,US Grade 8,Price,I wanted to cancel 10x more after your website asked me 4 times if I really wanted to cancel or not. Terrible.
Aug-24,US Grade 6,Customer Service,"The worst experience EVER from any paid online service, EVER. Not a single person has called me back after me leaving numerous voicemails and sending numerous emails. You must be doing pretty well if you don't care about single customers. "
Aug-24,US Grade 3,Price,The first year I paid $48 and the renewal price is almost double. I don't feel I use it enough to justify almost $100.
Aug-24,US Grade 4,Resource Quality,I feel like the price has significantly increased over the years (which may be for good reason) but I can't justify a nearly $90 spend.
Sep-24,US Grade 7,Variety of Materials,"i was looking for various subject in math science and english i flound some but also did not find alot on my subject matter needed 
 thank you nice site but not what i needed at this time cheers"
Sep-24,ks4,Variety of Materials,Just enough cultural/linguistic differences between American and Australian language in the business math worksheets - my students wouldn't understand some of the language and references used in the worksheets and I can't edit them to make changes.
Sep-24,sen,Variety of Materials,I wish I could order bulletin board and those kind of resources. Its a real pain having to print then laminate. Not enough time or paper.
Sep-24,slt,Variety of Materials,I used the trial to make a recommendation to others that I supervise. Very pleased and will recommend.
Sep-24,US Grade 2,Variety of Materials,My school uses another site and has a lot of resources o I won't use it as much as I originally thought I would.
Sep-24,esl,Variety of Materials,I am strictly looking for materials for my Newcomer EL students. Most of the materials I find are too advanced or were not designed for ELs.
Sep-24,esl,Variety of Materials,I am an online teacher and I just need more materials. I also find the price to be a little expensive. I will consider subscribing again in the future.
Sep-24,ey,Variety of Materials,"I have been teaching private lessons and using Twinkl's resources has helped me a lot during the past months. Yet, I'm currently on a break with some students that intend to return only in the next year, so I will probably not need to plan classes for the next 6 months or so."
Sep-24,US Grade 2,Variety of Materials,"I cancelled my subscription before the trial period ended; however, I was charged for the next month. Please research this. Thank you."
Sep-24,US Kindergarten,Variety of Materials,"When I signed up for the one month free membership, I received a message saying I would be notified before the month was up and before I was charged. I was not notified before that happened."
Sep-24,US Grade 2,Variety of Materials,"IXL, because I teach online now and many of the Twinkl resources are better for printing and I had to put a lot of time int fixing the activities to be digital friendly."
Sep-24,sen,Variety of Materials,"It was great using it. I used it for ""Eid-Ul-Adha"" presentation for my office only. I do not need it. However, I liked it a lot. I would love to get the free version for my son. As he is getting a lot of worksheets at school. I am not in serious need of this now."
Sep-24,US Grade 1,Variety of Materials,resources are great for my homeschool child but currently not using it enough to justify the monthly cost. May start again when ready
Sep-24,US Kindergarten,Variety of Materials,I LOVE THIS WEBSITE! I’ve been able to teach many children through using this website. But unfortunately I can not afford to have subscriptions of any kind right now. Only able to pay for necessities
Sep-24,US Grade 1,Variety of Materials,"I've currently experienced a change in districts, grade level and pay. Trying to find balance in everything. You guys have been a great resource!"
Sep-24,US Grade 2,Variety of Materials,I'm not teaching this whole year - I've recommended you to other teachers and hope they utilize your wonderful resources. I'll be back next year ;)
Sep-24,US Grade 3,Variety of Materials,I used this over the summer for my child. I do not need the resources right now because he is in school.
Sep-24,home ed,Customer Service,"It is shady to hide the option to Self service and cancel a free trial then ignore emails and live chat, not answer thr phone then attempt to charge my card then not even acknowledge it. Very unprofessional and shady to also not send notice of the account removal"
Sep-24,US Grade 5,Ease of Website,It is really annoying that you cannot see the worksheets clearly before downloading them. I also found most of the science worksheets lacking.
Sep-24,US Kindergarten,Ease of Website,"With the competition around, the membership is too pricey. Also, given there are so much material, navigation to a particular grade, topic is not great."
Sep-24,parent,Ease of Website,I am not currently working but I am homeschooling my child creating her work and using free sites like DK12 I can't afford to add any other bills. I do enjoy this site.
Sep-24,ks3,Ease of Website,You make canceling obtuse. This is the second time I am attempting to cancel and still don't know it if is canceled. That is bad business practice. If my card is charged I will complain and have my bank reverse the charge.
Sep-24,US Grade 5,Ease of Website,Not everything would download. The material is all amazing. That wasn't a problem but it wouldn't save to my Google drive or as a PDF.
Sep-24,US Grade 3,Ease of Website,"Just needed it for one thing. The wedsite is fine. I only wanted one thing, then to cancel my subscription. I don't need this stuff"
Sep-24,US Grade 7,Ease of Website,"My school has blocked my ability to download any resources, so I can't use any of the printouts you have even though they would be very helpful."
Sep-24,US Kindergarten,Variety of Materials,"I have not used this resource, and do not plan to use it in the future, but I think it is great for teachers!"
Sep-24,adult educator,Variety of Materials,I work for an agency that supports autistic kids and their caregivers. I don't feel comfortable sharing your activities or encouraging their caregivers to join. I have adapted some of your activities that I think they need. You help with time and getting great resources in their hands but I can not continue paying for that resource.
Sep-24,ks5,Variety of Materials,"The free trial was great, but I can't currently afford another subscription. Thank you for providing quality downloads for my classroom."

Sep-24,US Grade 4,Price,"I like the site, I just get what I need and then may not need it for a while. I have a number of other homeschool resources I'm using and need to keep my costs down. Thank you!"
Sep-24,US Grade 3,Resource Quality,"When I click to download resources, it will only download as a zip file instead of a downloadable document."
Sep-24,US Grade 1,Resource Quality,The materials didn't feel full of grace... some were good but some were a little cringy and confusing for my students!
Sep-24,slt,Resource Quality,"I had thought that I could set the limits of the random number generator to where I would like it to stop at, not just 0 - 1000"
Sep-24,US Grade 5,Resource Quality,I could download the pages but they would never open up so I could print. Always said unable to open . Was a waste of time.
Sep-24,adult educator,Resource Quality,"While this is a great resource, I was introduced to a program my school already had in place that will provide me the material I need. I was just unaware that my school had this program. Thank you for the trial, and keep up the great work!!"
Sep-24,US Pre K,Resource Quality,"Many of the resources required to resize in an editor or if printed directly from the site, were cut off at the bottom of the page. Some didn't print in full. It was rather frustrating to get things to print correctly."
Sep-24,sen,Resource Quality,"When I planned to buy an annual membership for this school year last year, it was about $15 cheaper."
Sep-24,US Grade 2,Resource Quality,This is a wonderful resource and I will tell others about it. You are very transparent about membership and kind to note when trial is expiring.
Sep-24,sen,Variety of Materials,"Lessons on using a computer, internet for Special Education students. Lessons that have presentations, worksheets, and interactive lessons."
Sep-24,ks5,Variety of Materials,I need computer science material but twinkl only has a few things. I saw some math stuff that could be applied but not enough to justify a membership

Sep-24,US Grade 6,Variety of Materials,"I am not using this membership at all. I didn't realize that the free trial had ended and that I was being charged. I would like a refund for the last two payments, please. Thank you!"
Sep-24,ey,Price,I think for teachers who really put their all into their work and buy supplies with their own money shouldn't have to pay too much for something like this. It's a great site but too expensive for membership.
Sep-24,US Grade 1,Price,I can’t remember but there has been several times I have specifically looked for items that just do not populate. I found a different site that offers material along state standards and is slightly cheaper than twinkle.
Sep-24,ey,Price,I cannot afford this monthly fee at this moment. I hope to see return! Keep up the good work Twinkl and Team are doing!
Sep-24,US Grade 3,Resource Quality,There were often issues with having the correct printing format or downloads being too large to view.

Sep-24,US Grade 4,Resource Quality,This is a great place to find worksheets and resources for teaching. Unfortunately I am no longer using the site.
Sep-24,US Grade 6,Variety of Materials,"Science Worksheets, specifically about wind altitude, density, air pressure. Most of what I see are just projects, not worksheets."
Sep-24,sen,Variety of Materials,Resources are really geared for elementary teachers -- did not find enough resources geared for Special Education High school students to justify the price of the subscription
Sep-24,US Grade 6,Variety of Materials,"I was charged today without my knowledge. Please cancel my subscription and refund the amount. 
 Thanks."
Sep-24,US Grade 4,Customer Service,I did not sign up for the Ultimate Subscription and was charged anyway. I have been on hold with Customer Service for an hour. I will be calling my credit card company to block any further charges. Please cancel my account and refund charges!
Sep-24,US Kindergarten,Customer Service,Hope have some story come with or reading come with . And hope pictures could be more cute and beautiful
Sep-24,US Grade 6,Customer Service,Thais subscription is a scam stealing money from hard working educators. You should be ashamed of the way you run your business.
Sep-24,US Grade 2,Customer Service,I have not logged in all year. I didn't even realize I was being charged. I would like to get a refund please.
Sep-24,ey,Customer Service,"It's really unfortunate how difficult it is to cancel this service. You are taking advantage of teachers who have little time and resources by making us jump through hoops to cancel. This really sours my opinion of your website, which I enjoyed using in general but I need to cancel because as a teacher, I do not have unlimited resources to keep paying for subscriptions that trap you. That is all. Goodbye."
Sep-24,Other,Customer Service,I have been trying to cancel this member ship for three months. Nobody ever picks up when I call and emails were not answered. I used this site once for a flyer and you have charged me for 3 months.
Sep-24,US Grade 2,Customer Service,"The membership was activated by mistake, and I found it difficult to navigate the cancellation process. I am frustrated and unsatisfied."
Sep-24,US Grade 3,Customer Service,"I did not subscribe to a monthly paid subscription, the username is wrong, and I never entered a card. Charges have come out of my account with a fake card number I don't have. I am reporting Twinkl for fraud and scamming educators who sacrifice so much to help others. Shame on you."
Sep-24,US Grade 7,Customer Service,"I’ve requested my service to be cancelled several time, but I keep getting billed through PayPal. If this does not work, I plan on reporting this to PayPal and possibly taking legal action to get past monthly fees back. All future reviews or ratings I give for twinkl - as well as word of mouth comments to other teachers - will be negative, especially with all the screens I had to repeatedly go through to get here. VERY dissatisfied."
Sep-24,US Grade 7,Customer Service,"You HAVE to make it easier to unsubscribe!! I have been trying for six months, and even though I supposedly am unsubscribed, you keep taking money out of my account. Or should I say stealing? I would like a refund of all of the bank withdrawals you have made."
Sep-24,sen,Ease of Website,I did not even know I had reactivated my memberbship and it was really hard figuring out how to cancel.
Sep-24,esl,Ease of Website,I thought I wasn't going to get drafted because it was very difficult to cancel and see how I was going to pay for it. I'd like a refund.
Sep-24,US Grade 5,Ease of Website,"I stopped using Twinkl a long time ago and forgot about it. I had no problem with your service, I just despise subscriptions so I'll never be anything but disappointed."
Sep-24,sen,Ease of Website,I have paid for the next month so I better have full access until October 14th . This is not clear. I should have access and then is unclear. Your website is very abnoxious to canel - therefore I will never join you again;.
Sep-24,adult educator,Ease of Website,"Resources are great for elementary school, some for middle school, but they are too easy for high school. This site is more useful for elementary education."
Sep-24,US Kindergarten,Ease of Website,"I couldn't find any graphics for hand signals for going to restroom, getting a tissue, needing a pencil, etcetera. That was the main thing I joined to find."
Sep-24,sen,Price,This account was signed in through my old schools email address. I never received any emails and was unaware I had this membership still. Was not impressed being charged and I would like my money back. I have not used this program in over a year and I will not be using it.

Sep-24,US Grade 6,Price,I did a free trial and forgot that I subscribed until over the summer when the payment kept getting declined for lack of funds. I don’t use the resources very often so I can’t justify the money continuing to come out of my account.

Sep-24,US Kindergarten,Ease of Website,"It's really difficult to navigate and find what i need. Searching brings up a slew on things, some related some not. Going to second or sub sections still feels like it's a jumble. Honestly, the most effective way i found was to Google specific resources i needed, and click a direct link to it on here vs trying to find it solely using this site."
Sep-24,US Grade 1,Ease of Website,The price of the unlimited membership has gone up $40 in two years and the resources are exactly the same. I can afford this but I refuse this type of price gouging. See ya.
Sep-24,US Grade 6,Price,"I thought once you bought a membership you had access to resources forever, that's why I bought it the first time instead of going with competitors."
Sep-24,US Grade 3,Resource Quality,"Your material is fantastic. I am not teaching these grade levels anymore (because we lost the grant for our elementary after-school program) and don't need the product.

Oct-24,US Grade 7,Resource Quality,You had an activity for Donald Trump and not one for Kamala Harris. Donald Trump has 34 felons. He does not need to be celebrated. This is why I am cancelling. You probably think that Donald trump is a good human and he is not.

Oct-24,US Grade 8,Ease of Website,"You advertise UNLIMITED downloads but when I downloaded what was deemed to be too much a 24 hold was put on my account. That is not my definition of unlimited. My definition is how much I want, when I want. If it is limited to x number of downloads in y amount of time, it should be advertised that way, not as unlimited."

Oct-24,sen,Price,I had cancelled this subscription over a year ago and was charged again for it. I am very unhappy with this.
Oct-24,parent,Price,"It's not great to charge a relatively expensive subscription fee for educators who are already making pennies, and in return we receive mediocre products that we have to edit and change anyway. Its better to use TeachersPayTeachers. At least that way you can support a fellow educator who is also poor."

Oct-24,US Pre K,Price,We are not currently doing home-schooling and don't really need access to these materials at the moment. I believe it is a great resource and we will be looking into it more seriously if we decide to do homeschooling with our children.
Oct-24,ks4,Resource Quality,"I believe I cancelled the membership immediately after I signed up because I realized there is nothing I can use on the site. I would like to be reimbursed for the months I paid for this- I have not used it at all, and feel that I was trapped into this subscription unwillingly."
Oct-24,US Grade 5,Resource Quality,"I’m annoyed because I cancelled the membership earlier this month, but it charged me. Apparently I have to click cancel 3-4 times to actually cancel. Very frustrating."

Oct-24,home ed,Resource Quality,I wasn't notified of a $90 payment that came out of my account today. A reminder would be nice to have received so I had the option to renew or cancel. i seriously thought I cancelled my subscription back in January. I did download a pdf a few days ago but I figured it was in the free section seeing as I was able to do so with no warnings saying it would automatically renew my subscription.

Oct-24,US Pre K,Variety of Materials,I don't like it taken off my debit card. Every month my card gets locked because I have to pay for your membership and also charged a fee for you being international. I would rather not have the hassle of going to the bank every time my card is locked.

Oct-24,sen,Resource Quality,"Downloading resources is very difficult, as some of them indicate the path is too long, some need to be extracted, others just don't work."
Oct-24,sen,Resource Quality,Great stuff but I don't use them much and I have to adjust most assignments based on my students needs and end up needing to make more than find things.

Oct-24,sen,Customer Service,"The amount of buttons I had to click to cancel a free trial and prevent auto-renewal was insane. I shouldn't have to ask 4 times to cancel my membership and get bombarded with ads. Also- immediately cancelling a free trial through cancelling your membership (to prevent auto-renewal) is shady business. I won't come back again, thanks."
Oct-24,parent,Ease of Website,It was too hard to login to the app. My ability to set my login and password had expired and I never had time to deal with it until I was forced to “reset” it to cancel before I had to pay for something I was not able to try.
Oct-24,parent,Price,Your site isn’t good I’m paying for nothing and your customer service is horrible nobody ever replies

Oct-24,US Kindergarten,Price,i cant print out everything easily its always giving me problems. the material is great but that is about it

Oct-24,US Grade 4,Resource Quality,"The science resources were inadequate for my needs. Not rigourous enough, variety of science concepts were limited."
Oct-24,US Grade 8,Variety of Materials,As my homeschool students have gone into junior high and high school there was no need for these resources anymore.

Oct-24,parent,Resource Quality,I enjoyed material. My only complaint is that the answer key to one for the math worksheets had incorrect answers.
Oct-24,parent,Resource Quality,I love it and will consider joining again when I am in a position to utilize the resources more often:-)

Nov-24,ey,Variety of Materials,I would absolutely love to keep your service as my highly autistic 7 year old uses it all the time but I can no longer get afford it as I'm a si gle mom of two that had recently lost my main source of income
Nov-24,US Grade 1,Price,"This is a fantastic site for homeschooling parents, teachers, and parents trying to include additional resources for their kids!"
Nov-24,sen,Resource Quality,I wish materials were more interactive rather than just powerpoints or print and go (which requires prep work to set up and is hard to accomplish when you are working on multiple skills with various groups back to back).
Nov-24,US Pre K,Resource Quality,Not interested. Curious about your sign language material but no pictures are shown with signs and they come across as confusing.
Nov-24,ey,Resource Quality,Not practical for preschool age children. Printable are too advanced and videos do not keep their attention.

Nov-24,US Grade 2,Resource Quality,I used the resource to help set up a presentation for soldiers presenting to a second grade class. I teach college level classes so I will probably not use this again any time soon. Excellent resource.
Nov-24,US Pre K,Variety of Materials,I needed more clipart that was easy to print out. I wanted to print out things for my felt board for my preschool music class.

Nov-24,sen,Variety of Materials,"I need dyslexia specific resources. In one advertisement I saw for your site, I thought there would be more. There wasn't. Only a few that I could use.

Nov-24,tutor,Variety of Materials,"It's always a delight to use your resources, unfortunately I'm not well off enough to afford it for now."
Nov-24,US Kindergarten,Variety of Materials,I didn't have enough time to look at everything you have. It would probably be better for me to join before the school year starts to have more time to look at everything. I may come back when I have more time to invest.
Nov-24,US Pre K,Variety of Materials,"As soon as I have the income to keep it completely, I will be back. This site is great and really helped my daughter"

Nov-24,US Grade 5,Resource Quality,"I got this last year for an assignment that my son needed some photos for a tri board for. I've kept it each month because I knew as soon as I had time I could come and choose a bunch of lesson plans for him. I've come today and found the website to be difficult. Out of the five lessons I looked at, 3 would not download, and the others didn't actually teach the lesson they were categorized under... but just asked questions that a child wouldn't know without the lesson. I'm extremely disappointed and can't believe how much I've spent to literally not even have one lesson for him to do."
Nov-24,sen,Resource Quality,I have tried to cancel this for months now and you continue to charge me. I haven’t used a resource and I would like a full refund!

Nov-24,sen,Resource Quality,"I'm going to try Education.com
 Twinkl is okay, but the one thing I hate is the amount of blue ink that is wasted every time I print. I understand putting your name/logo, but I don't need a whole banner of blue on the bottom. It's distracting for students and wastes ink. There is too much ""decorative fluff"" on the pages which makes the actual content smaller."
Nov-24,US Grade 3,Resource Quality,The quality of the content was hit or miss and there is lots of heavily Christian content that is promoted as secular educational materials
Nov-24,Other,Resource Quality,"I may be back the next time I am looking for a specific resource. I don't like the monthly subscription piece, though."

Nov-24,US Pre K,Price,You provide a wealth of information. There is so much that I have no need for. Have you ever thought of a mini subscription to just one age group?
Nov-24,ey,Price,Im a stay at home mom just trying to teach a child in my care and i can find pages for free. Since i dont have enough to pay subscription
Nov-24,US Pre K,Variety of Materials,I am looking for everything thing. Unique things and this website jus has a hand full of things and it’s all the same.

Nov-24,US Grade 6,Customer Service,"You advertise that I can cancel anytime, but it required many steps and temptations. Not a site I would recommend to friends."
Nov-24,US Grade 1,Ease of Website,I don't like how the downloads are hard to access and how difficult it is to edit the editable downloads. The amount of steps to access downloads even after extracted is ridiculous.
Nov-24,US Grade 8,Ease of Website,I find it difficult to find the pages I want to print. downloads difficult to determine exactly what worksheets they are unless I only download 1 at a time which is not time effective
Nov-24,US Grade 4,Ease of Website,"Teachers Pay Teachers and Super Teachers Worksheets, both are easier to find specific grade level topics more quickly."
Nov-24,ks5,Resource Quality,"twinkl was a lifesaver when I was teaching younger children, but when I made the move to upper grades, the curriculum had less wiggle room and I wasn't able to find as many things that were as applicable. I'd still recommend twinkl to those teaching early childhood."
Nov-24,parent,Customer Service,I hate when this kid of companies using wrong marketing by charging people without their consent. You are stealing our money and that’s what kept me away from you
Nov-24,US Grade 1,Customer Service,cancelled and still charging me. rip off website my credit card will be getting my money back. scam website.
Nov-24,US Grade 2,Customer Service,I cancelled last month October and still got charged in November. Worst experience. Don’t recommend to any teachers. I contacted customer service and never got a reply.
Nov-24,US Grade 2,Customer Service,Extremely unhappy about the deceptive way you need to hit a cancellation option 3x before actually ending the membership. I tried canceling the previous month and thought I had canceled until I saw the charge in my bank account.
Nov-24,US Pre K,Customer Service,I already cancelled and have cancellation emails! I complained and asked for a refund and the next email was indicating i renewed the account!!!!! and you planned to charge me again! I will be putting in a horrible review of your services!
Nov-24,ey,Customer Service,I had asked 3 times to cancel and continue to be charged. I want to cancel and work like a refund for the last 3 months I’ve been charged
Nov-24,US Grade 4,Customer Service,"I did not want this membership, I think I accepted a trial and the membership continued for 4 months from there. I would like a full refund please."
Nov-24,ey,Ease of Website,"Please don't make it so difficult to actually cancel my membership because I thought I had already officially cancelled it several months ago but I guess it never went through due to your unhelpful un-userfriendliness. I do like that you have materials in Zulu though, very diverse and inclusive."
Nov-24,ks5,Ease of Website,I hate it when you intentionally make it difficult to unsubsubscribe. I would have paused my membership but just looking at the hostile UI that made me click through 3 different options settled my decision to cancel permanently.
Nov-24,parent,Ease of Website,The creating membership was extremely confusing and I ended up signing up for 2 accounts thinking it hadn’t worked and got charged twice.
Nov-24,US Grade 5,Ease of Website,"I thought that I had cancelled this subscription two months ago…you make it very hard to cancel a subscription which cost me extra money. I am taking a screen shot of this form, and if I am charged again next month, I will report you to the BBB and any other agency that would be appropriate."
Nov-24,US Grade 6,Ease of Website,Overall it's decent and I might come back. I homeschool my son. Kind of hard to find what I need on the website.

Nov-24,esl,Price,"I never wanted this membership, I I thought I had cancelled it. the cancelling process is long and confusing. I was charged and I am very unhappy with that."
Nov-24,home ed,Price,I cancelled my membership like years ago and somehow I'm paying 10$ a month. I know it was cancelled. How long does this go back?!
Nov-24,parent,Price,"I cancelled this membership last month, but was billed again this month. I just cancelled again, but I will be disputing the charge with PayPal. You make it difficult to cancel, and your multiple ""Are you sure"" screens and the the requirement to confirm ""cancel anyway"" on more than one screen are misleading. I'll warn other teachers away from doing business with you."
Nov-24,US Grade 4,Price,I didn’t realize that I was paying a monthly fee for over year now. My husband just asked what this subscription was…I just wish I would have know that I had a membership. That was a lot of money wasted.
Nov-24,US Pre K,Price,I do not recall signing up for this membership. I just noticed that I was have been being billed and never used it.
Nov-24,US Kindergarten,Price,i forgot to cancel this before it renewed. I dont use this enough as I am not a teacher. I would like a refund. I dont have that kind of money to spend.
Nov-24,US Kindergarten,Price,I did not mean to sign up for this. I couldn't even use the free services. I would like my $9.00 refunded.
Nov-24,US Grade 7,Price,Wish I had cancelled this early. Unfortunately it's not a resource I can afford nor use. I didn't get back to you to cancel in time of the 1 year renewal.
Nov-24,US Grade 4,Price,I tried to cancel before it auto-renewed and it did not cancel. I am frustrated that it did not work and still charged me.
Nov-24,sen,Price,I did not even know I was subscribed to this website. I have been making payments without my knowledge. And the cancelation process was ridiculous. I had to scroll all the way to the bottom of my screen to press “cancel” at least 3 times. The process felt dishonest
Nov-24,US Grade 3,Price,I am no longer teaching in person - just online and can't use this - although I just paid for a year last week without realizing it until I saw it on my credit card.
Nov-24,US Grade 3,Price,I had two accounts for over 3 months. I didnt realize i had another account under my personal email dustygail @ gmail.com
Nov-24,sen,Price,Make the cancellation process better. I cancelled back in August I was under the impression that my subscription would in fact be cancelled only to find out that it wasn't. I have been charged for the past 3 months. I had to go through the cancellation process 3 times before it brought me to the current page.
Nov-24,US Grade 1,Price,"You did not inform me payment was coming up, there was a bundle package with it, and that there was a price increase. Caught my bills off guard."
Nov-24,ks1,Price,It is great and I look forward to trying it again in the future but I currently do not have the money for it.
Nov-24,sen,Price,"I was unaware I was being billed. My mistake, however I have not found this websight very useful. Seems like a waste of alot of money."
Nov-24,US Grade 3,Resource Quality,I thought I canceled this after the free trial. I have been out of work since last December with stage 4 cancer . I reached out several times and no one contacted me
Nov-24,sen,Resource Quality,I was in 4th-6th grade but moved to Pre-K and i find the pre-k is not as engaging or as much available for those ages. Plus I wish you could print directly from the website without having to down load it first.
Nov-24,US Grade 4,Variety of Materials,My kids are in specialty schools and I don't use the services enough and they are getting to middle school grade and don't really do the stuff from here.
Nov-24,slt,Ease of Website,"I really enjoy Twinkl. However I think you should mention more of the extras that you showed during my cancellation. I didn't realize Twinkl had ALL of the extra stuff to offer. At this time I do not use my membership enough and need to spend my resources elsewhere, but will keep Twinkl in mind for the future."
Nov-24,US Pre K,Price,I actually used it so infrequently that I forgot I had the membership. I am no longer working in the schools.
Nov-24,sen,Price,Me encantaron los recursos y los use mucho con mis estudiantes . Solo que el precio es alto para mi y no puedo pagarlo. Gracias por crear tan buen material .
Dec-24,US Grade 3,Price,I'm so sad to cancel this subscription. Perhaps I can get my school district on board with a subscription K-4 next year.
Dec-24,US Grade 3,Price,I don’t use it enough to justify the cost but this was such an amazing resource and I wish more people knew about it
Dec-24,sen,Resource Quality,According to my bank account I have already been billed on November 27. I expect that my account will remain active until that time next year
Dec-24,adult educator,Variety of Materials,"Please add more resources formatted for mobile devices. My students are all remote and most do not have a desktop or laptop, but join class via smartphone therefore all of your content must be re-formatted (less content per page, large fonts, etc) so it can be legible for students using a hand-held device."
Dec-24,esl,Variety of Materials,Twinkl is a wonderful and affordable resource! I will definitely resubscribe if I go back to teaching!
Dec-24,ey,Variety of Materials,I was unexpectedly released from my position at the beginning of September and didn't realize I was still subscribed to this service. I am unemployed and cannot afford to keep it until I find a new job.
Dec-24,US Grade 1,Ease of Website,The materials are not compatible with Google Suite and the downloads are automatically opened with Word instead of Google.
Dec-24,US Grade 1,Ease of Website,"Not very easy to find product and just print. Would subscribe if it was easier to search, find and print."
Dec-24,Other,Price,Your process for cancelling requires too many steps. It is an extremely predatory practice. You should be ashamed of yourselves.
Dec-24,US Grade 5,Price,It was supposed to be free and then you attempted to charge my bank account which I never gave my bank information.
Dec-24,US Pre K,Resource Quality,"Twinkl is a lovely resource, but unfortunately I do not currently have the need due to a change in circumstance."
Dec-24,US Grade 3,Resource Quality,Twinkl can be very hard to navigate and find the resources you want in a logical way. Better organization would truly make it a stellar website.
Dec-24,US Kindergarten,Resource Quality,"while I appreciated the volume of creative options you provided, the lead teacher seems to have her own resources for activities"
Dec-24,ks4,Variety of Materials,I teach high school chemistry and the resources I find won't open once downloaded or they are not what I'm looking for on the 10-12 level.
Dec-24,US Grade 6,Price,Don't make it a scavenger hunt to cancel membership. I hate when companies make it difficult to find the cancel membership button.
Dec-24,US Pre K,Price,I have tried to cancel before and I am frustrated that it didn’t work. Am I eligible for a refund? Emily Volz
Dec-24,sen,Price,I never wanted the membership. I created a membership to see what Twinkl was and then got added without my permission.
Dec-24,US Pre K,Price,"I'm so sorry, but I thought I had signed up for a FREE account so that I could access just one resource. I am an educational consultant, not a classroom teacher. The drop downs do not reflect my opinion of your product, but options were limited."
Dec-24,US Grade 2,Price,I thought I already clicked through canceling and was surprised to get a bill this month. Disappointed in this kind of behavior as it is very gotcha-like behavior just to take advantage of users.
Dec-24,ks5,Variety of Materials,"I teach secondary, this is geared to elementary. We’ve found some great stuff that I can partially utilise for my art classes but I’m forced to increase the information or difficulty to make the standards or be something 9-12th graders can’t do in 5 minutes."
Dec-24,US Grade 3,Resource Quality,"I was looking for more basic Addition & subtraction worksheets. Working with 2 & 3 digit problems, as well as others that may be helpful. I feel like this material doesn’t teach my child it’s more of a summer school activity so that he doesn’t forget."
Dec-24,ey,Price,I cancelled my membership 2 months ago so why am I being charged. Your company is just taking money when people are struggling
Dec-24,ks4,Price,I am currently out of work and need all of my resources to cover my living expenses. I have not used this service in a couple of months and would like a refund for the months of November and December.
Dec-24,US Grade 1,Price,I did not realized I signed up for this and have lost money I had no idea i was being charged for. Refund of all fees would be great! i have never used this service!
Dec-24,ks4,Price,I didn’t even know I was subscribed to this. I’ve been charged since September and I’ve never used this.
Dec-24,US Grade 1,Price,"I have tried cancelling this 3 times. I'm not sure what is happening, but, I CANNOT afford for this to still be coming out of my account. I shouldn't have to weed through 3 or 4 different cancellation windows. Seems shady."
Dec-24,US Grade 4,Price,"Your subscription service is so scammy and you make people click through a ridiculous amount of 'Cancel' buttons to quit.
 
 I will be actively recommending against Twinkl to anybody that asks me about it."
Dec-24,US Grade 3,Price,I cancelled this before the December charge date and it still charged me for December and now I have a $32 overdraft fee on top of it because I had cancelled the subscription and therefore did not include it in my budget.
Dec-24,sen,Price,I cancelled this 2 months ago and continue to be charged. This is ridiculous. Please refund the last 2 months.
Dec-24,Other,Price,"I work for a job coaching service. We used some of these for our skill building but I otherwise cannot say I have much here i can use further. I appreciate the supplies present and see how they are very helpful, but they cannot help me further with my own work."
Dec-24,parent,Price,"I wasn’t using this resource, so at the moment I don’t want to keep paying for a subscription I’m not using."
Dec-24,US Pre K,Price,"This is the only resource I can find for Australian themed materials. I am an Aussie living in the States and so I'd like to have my classroom with an Aussie feel however again I cannot find it anywhere else, so I love that you guys offer that. Ask for now, I cannot afford it although the price is wonderful I will come back when the time allows."
Dec-24,ks4,Variety of Materials,I work with grades 5-12th grade and was struggling finding enough resources that meet my state's level of rigor.
Dec-24,parent,Variety of Materials,I tried to cancel before but forgot my password when I found the right email i notice on my paypal account I was still being charge for the past three months I would like a refund of 27.00
Dec-24,US Grade 8,Price,"I won't need the membership for probably close to another year., so it doesn't make sense to pay for a year that I won't be using it."
Dec-24,US Grade 3,Resource Quality,I don't need the membership regularly but the few things I looked at about holidays were not hitting the spot/somewhat inaccurate
Dec-24,sen,Resource Quality,"Vocational resources for high school special Ed students. I just switched positions, if I’m able to use Twinkl resources I will come back."
Dec-24,US Grade 3,Resource Quality,I needed access to some resources for a school assignment. Just a couple more years of college and then I will be back.
Dec-24,US Grade 6,Variety of Materials,"I don't have ppt on my computer. I am looking for Google Slides formats, and they are few and far between for Spanish materials on this site."
Dec-24,US Grade 6,Resource Quality,"I understand the need to increase membership prices as you have added many resources. However, I only utilize math worksheet (and some science) so I wish the price was less or that there was an option for a cheaper membership. The price started at $50, which I found worth it, but now that it has almost doubled, I cannot justify the cost. Please reach out if there is anything that can be done. abussanich@paramusschools.org"
Dec-24,US Grade 7,Resource Quality,"I was using this resource for my International Students. This school year I only have USA students who need assistance with study for the private school entrance exam ISEE, SSAT, HSPT or SHSAT"
Dec-24,US Grade 4,Variety of Materials,My husband lost his job and I feel I don't use it enough to justify this expense. It's a great resource though and I may rejoin again in the future.
Dec-24,US Pre K,Variety of Materials,"Thanks for the resources I did use. I am retiring and teaching 1/2 preschool and I have a plethora of resources to use now, including some of the resources I got from Twinkl."
Dec-24,US Grade 6,Customer Service,Yes I’ve tried to cancel my membership twice and I keep getting charged. You owe me $9 and if I don’t get it I’m contacting a lawyer. It should not be this hard to cancel a membership.
Dec-24,sen,Customer Service,I have tried to cancel this membership several times but kept getting charged- I'm really frustrated and have asked for a refund on December and that you ensure my account is cancelled. Thank you
Dec-24,US Grade 1,Customer Service,I don’t like that there is no option to talk to a live person…I’ve been trying to cancel this membership for a while now
Dec-24,US Pre K,Customer Service,"I was told I would get an email a week before my free trial ended and my account was charged. I did not get an email and was charged anyway. I had considered keeping the membership, but the inconsistency in policy has annoyed me."
Dec-24,US Grade 1,Customer Service,"I signed up for the free trial to use some resources. I ended up not using the resources as often as I would have liked and cancelled during the free trial period. However, I was still charged the ultimate membership fee for 4 months after I cancelled. You need to notify members if and when they are being charged, especially after using the free trial. I know that you aren't going to want to do that, so you still get your money but that's real sus and will create high turnover rates instead of continuing customers. Use a better business model"
Dec-24,ks1,Customer Service,Please refund the amount taken out for 2025. I thought I canceled this last time they automatically deducted charges. I am no longer a teacher.
Dec-24,parent,Customer Service,"I canceled this back in August, but I did not notice this kept being billed. I am not sure why the cancelation did not go through."
Dec-24,US Grade 4,Ease of Website,I never wanted the membership and then it's so much to cancel it I just paused it and just got an email saying It will restart again if I Dont cancel and I went in and tried to cancel and had to restart inorder to cancel soI got charged 9 dollars for no reason.
Dec-24,US Grade 5,Ease of Website,I was under the impression that I had canceled this membership shortly after signing up. I remember going through the many screens and clicking on cancel anyway. Now I was charged the $8. Unfortunately we didn't use the product. Is there anyway I can kindly get a refund? Please. Thank you.
Dec-24,US Grade 1,Ease of Website,"I flip flop between subbing for ESY and working in ABA. I just don’t use the subscription enough year round, but it definitely saved me when I had to sub until the end of ESY with zero notice last summer!"
Dec-24,sen,Variety of Materials,I am a special education teacher and am looking for more materials that cater to my students needs. There are not many options available on your website.
Dec-24,US Kindergarten,Variety of Materials,I don't like that I can't se a more specifoc preview before downloading even if it is woth aa waatermark. The fact that I haad to download to see what's in is not useful.
Dec-24,ks1,Variety of Materials,"I appreciate the variety and quality of your resources, however, I don't have a great enough need for them to justify a subscription."
Dec-24,US Pre K,Variety of Materials,I will sign up soon under the school name not under my name so I can give all teachers user name and password
Dec-24,US Pre K,Variety of Materials,I've retired so I'm watching pennies and no longer will use the resources. I've been a twinkl member for years and it's been great.
Dec-24,ey,Variety of Materials,I would like a refund because I did not know for months it was charging me and I’m no longer a teacher
Dec-24,US Pre K,Customer Service,I have tried several time to contact your company via email and phone and have unsuccessfully been able to cancel my membership however your company continues to take out a monthly payment and you can see clearly that it has been a while since I've access the materials
Dec-24,US Grade 3,Customer Service,I do not recall signing up for this. I have been charged for a year and have never used it. Very frustrated.
Dec-24,US Kindergarten,Customer Service,"I canceled this already and was charged again. that why I give Twinkl a 2 rating. Once should be enough, and there's not enough Kindergarten activities"
Dec-24,ks4,Customer Service,"There is an unexpected charge from you on my acct after my membership renewed, and I cannot get anyone to answer my questions."
Dec-24,US Grade 4,Customer Service,"I had already canceled once, and then was charged again. I am now canceling again and hoping this time I will no longer be charged again. I tried calling for help, but listening to the same message over and over was driving me crazy. I tried to select 2 for the callback option, which then proceeded to keep repeating the Twinkl Cares message over and over again."
Dec-24,US Grade 6,Customer Service,I HAVE TRIED TO CANCEL FOR THREE MONTHS I NEVER USE THIS! HOW DARE YOU KEEP CHARGING ME MONTH AFTER MONTH
Dec-24,US Pre K,Customer Service,Never got any notification that my subscription was starting and it is hard to reach customer service. Kept getting disconnected.
Dec-24,parent,Ease of Website,I came to this website as a parent seeking resources during a disaster that prevented my children from going to school from a month. It was unbelievably complicated/impossibleto cancel during the free trial.
Dec-24,US Kindergarten,Ease of Website,"Ridiculously hard to cancel membership and confusing, thought I had cancelled last month but missed the very last cancel anyways screen and now have had to pay for another month."
Dec-24,ta,Ease of Website,I don't think I've ever needed to confirm cancellation this many times. You need one-click cancellation. I will not recommend you to other people for this reason.
Dec-24,ks3,Ease of Website,"I thought I had canceled, but I guess I didn't click ""cancel anyway"" enough times when I tried before. I feel like it's unnecessarily hard to cancel and was tricked into continuing the membership."
Dec-24,Other,Ease of Website,Too many emails. I unfortunately registered and then forgot about the service until I’d see a spam email or the charge. As a music therapy student the resources aren’t what I’ll need in a subscription format. It’s easier to buy individual resources as needed than have a monthly subscription.
Dec-24,sen,Ease of Website,I don't like having to download everything and then have the files be too big that I am not able to sue the resource.
Dec-24,Other,Ease of Website,I try to use as many free resources as possible to meet my needs as a girl scout troop leader and a school librarian.
Dec-24,US Grade 3,Price,"Yeah, I'm cancelling because my membership is not up for renewal until February, 2025 and you sent through the payment TODAY, December 12, 2024. I WANT IT REMOVED IMMEDIATELY. That's why I am cancelling. If you can't manage this then, I can't trust your organization to keep my information secure."
Dec-24,librarian,Price,"This is a wonderful site for teachers - I work in a library offering coloring sheets, dot to dots, and easy crafts for free. I feel almost $100 for the few things I use is a bit too high for our library."
Dec-24,US Pre K,Price,"Absolutly loved your site and used many things. Unfortunately I am no longer working with a preschool at the time. If anything changes, I'll be back."
Dec-24,librarian,Variety of Materials,"1) Price 2) the fact that I had to click multiple times to cancel - I cancel - You are not cancelled yet - click again! Nope, not yet - click yet again! Ridiculous."
Dec-24,US Grade 7,Variety of Materials,I mainly used Twinkl for homeschooling and my child returned to public school. I also used it for my art classes and thought many resources were wonderful! Thank you!
Jan-25,parent,Ease of Website,"I signed up for this to get resources as a parent for my high school special ed child. I could not get ANY resources for him, as the only selections given for age groups were up to grade 8."
Jan-25,adult educator,Ease of Website,"I do not need the subscription except for today to prepare for presenting the Universal Declaration to all ages. The website has a plethora of distractions and is, as it should be, geared to children, and so doesn't meet my needs well enough. I was just trying to create a simple powerpoint, not launching a career in teaching OR human rights."
Jan-25,sen,Ease of Website,"It's very difficulty to find activities pertinent to me(SLP) without sifting through all ""spring"" activities, which was time consuming."
Jan-25,slt,Ease of Website,I'm a counselor & couldn't find quiet what I was looking for. Thank you for your service to teachers!
Jan-25,adult educator,Ease of Website,All I needed was a coloring sheet for the Royal Standard flag and couldn't find it anywhere else. Thank you for having it!
Jan-25,home ed,Price,"You have a good variety of products, I do not use this type of product enough to make it worth paying for this. Have a blessed day"
Jan-25,ks5,Price,The price along with my other subscriptions is too high for the amount of high school materials that I could find to use
Jan-25,US Kindergarten,Resource Quality,"The materials are great, but I have to modify them greatly to make them useful for my students. It is less work to just create my own materials."
Jan-25,home ed,Resource Quality,"I couldn’t find any phoneme worksheets or stories that use multiple of the spellings /digraphs that all say the same sound, which I have found to be the most successful way to quickly improve reading ability (like words that say ‘sh’ including with the spellings sh / ch / ti / ci all used in the same worksheet)."
Jan-25,US Pre K,Resource Quality,The pages to print were out of alignment. I first thought it was just the one packet that I downloaded but found this to be a reoccurring issue.
Jan-25,parent,Resource Quality,"I like the illustration style much more than other similar platforms, I will come back if I ever need to get more resources."
Jan-25,ey,Variety of Materials,I cannot figure out any way to print or download every time I downloaded and went to the download. It wouldn’t open so way too difficult.
Jan-25,ey,Variety of Materials,I was hoping for more PE and physical activity lesson plans to implement into my pre K gymnastics program.
Jan-25,Other,Variety of Materials,"I wanted to get 1 or 2 documents. It's a great resource, but I don't plan to use it enough to make sense of the cost."
Jan-25,home ed,Variety of Materials,"There are limited physical education resources, and that is my main content area. The dance resources use BESR, and I use BASTE, so those aren't aligned with the visuals I use."
Jan-25,ks4,Price,"It is a great resource but there are so many resources to pay for, I have to decide which ones I can afford to keep up with."
Jan-25,parent,Variety of Materials,The amount of times the payment was attempted on my card left a bad taste. Multiple times during the day just didn’t work for me.
Jan-25,librarian,Variety of Materials,"We are a library that likes the resources for the holidays, but we don't have the budget to pay for this subscription."
Jan-25,US Kindergarten,Resource Quality,I currently teach Russian Immersion Program. The materials here are in English only. I might renew membership when I return to teaching in English program.
Jan-25,US Grade 2,Resource Quality,"I used it mostly while I was homeschooling, but my kids are both now in private school. It's an excellent resource and I loved it!"
Jan-25,US Grade 3,Resource Quality,"Your lessons are amazing, but I am not working at the moment and getting a job is not looing good thus far. I am sad to go but every little bit of money helps with basics and bills."
Jan-25,US Kindergarten,Resource Quality,"My school has many resources that align to our lessons and I am not in need of Twinkl. The products are very good, just not needed."
Jan-25,US Pre K,Resource Quality,"Will likely come back when my children are older, we just aren’t using the membership enough to continue to pay for it"
Jan-25,ks3,Variety of Materials,"I only used it once and I have tried to cancel my membership every month and every time i think i have completed the from correctely, i find out that i have something missing."
Jan-25,esl,Variety of Materials,Sometimes I find errors in the ELL resources - sometimes I can tell that the ELL resources are not created by native English speakers.
Jan-25,esl,Variety of Materials,I teach 8th grade and find the resources are too low and insufficient for the grade level and subject/curriculum.
Jan-25,US Grade 1,Variety of Materials,I am not teaching subjects that require twinkl. i only used it for summer school and I am no longer teaching summer school. Thanks.
Jan-25,sen,Variety of Materials,More non-childish special Ed materials. I teach young teenagers with special needs and most of the cognitively-appropriate materials are infantilizing. It’s easier for me to just make the materials myself.
Jan-25,US Pre K,Variety of Materials,"I wanted more games for ages 6 and under but couldn't find any I like much. Like escape rooms, scavenger hunts, etc"
Jan-25,US Pre K,Variety of Materials,"I don't currently have a need for this membership, but I may resume teaching in the future and resubscribe. One piece of feedback: I used the stories on here quite a bit, but I do not have PowerPoint. It would be amazing if more of the stories were available as PDFs!"
Jan-25,sen,Variety of Materials,"I have no memory of resigning up again, just saw a charge on my account. I love the site, but I have zero extra cash right now."
Jan-25,ks3,Variety of Materials,None - incredibly useful resource especially for teaching a language other than Spanish which is hard to come across resources.
Jan-25,US Kindergarten,Variety of Materials,I plan on continuing my membership in the future but I have enough resources to fulfill my curriculum for the year and not enough money to maintain my membership until it is needed again. I love this site and its resources thank you
Jan-25,US Grade 6,Variety of Materials,I am not a teacher. I am a parent who was using Twinkle as supplemental work to help my daughter. She is working with tutors now. thanks
Jan-25,US Grade 7,Customer Service,Can not do as site claimed and when reach out for help does noyhing but run around. Will use someone else who helps Thanks
Jan-25,US Grade 7,Price,I was diagnosed with breast cancer last September and I'm undergoing chemotherapy. I'm not working at the moment so I haven't been able to use Twinkl these past months.
Jan-25,esl,Customer Service,"I have been paying for this membership that I did not realize that I had. I thought I had the account through my work email, so did not understand why I was continuing to be charged. Is there any way that I can get a refund for the 4 months that I've been paying $9/month?
 I sincerely hope that I am NOT charged AGAIN in January for this!"
Jan-25,ks4,Customer Service,"Twinkl automatically renewed free trials that I know I canceled and was charging me twice a month from two different accounts! Obviously partly my fault for not paying attention, but it's not even a resource that I use. The resources are difficult to find/generic/ babyish/ need too much modification, etc. Also Twinkl charged me $12 dollars shipping (I think) for my ""free"" planner. Nobody answers the customer service number - high volume of calls! I wonder why!?. I hope my accounts cancel for real this time!!"
Jan-25,US Kindergarten,Customer Service,"After receiving a receipt that states a refund can be requested until January 26,2025 and then being told that I actually only had 14 days after my trial to request a refund I have been lied to. I will not use a company that lies to the customers."
Jan-25,sen,Customer Service,you have been giving me the run around in trying to cancel this account for months. Please cancel.
Jan-25,librarian,Customer Service,I did not realize I had a membership I had to pay for. Reminders about payment would have been nice.
Jan-25,US Kindergarten,Customer Service,Try to copy off American sites when it comes to cancelling plans instead of not being direct straight forward
Jan-25,US Kindergarten,Ease of Website,"I have logged on to cancel 3 times. You make the cancel process take 4 screens, which is outrageous, a scam to have people keep unknowingly paying. Absolutely awful."
Jan-25,ey,Ease of Website,"I swear I cancelled from my membership before the billing cycle but I was charged anyway. The process to cancel is annoying because you have to click ""cancel anyway"" so many times."
Jan-25,home ed,Ease of Website,I thought I cancelled months ago. I'm angry that I've been charged for something I haven't even used because I thought it was cancelled.
Jan-25,Other,Ease of Website,I had canceled this membership previously. Apparently the cancellation didn’t go through and I’ve been getting charged for a membership I thought I no longer had. I just canceled again having to go through multiple pages of clicking cancel. It was incredibly frustrating and I feel like twinkl has done this on purpose to continue getting money from people who sincerely thought they had cancelled.
Jan-25,US Grade 5,Ease of Website,I have cancelled my subscription 4 times and continue to get charged. I’m extremely unsatisfied and would like reimbursement for the last 4 months.
Jan-25,US Grade 6,Ease of Website,I couldn't sign in because the website is not very compatible with my phone. I would like my money back because I never used it at all.
Jan-25,ey,Ease of Website,"The website and more importantly the app aren’t user friendly. Needs work. However, this is an amazing resource to have for teachers and parents. Absolutely love it!"
Jan-25,sen,Ease of Website,"Love this site, but I can't pay that much for something I don't use very often. It would be nice if there was an option for $ for a certain amount of resources."
Jan-25,ey,Price,I had two duplicate accounts and one free membership. There was no notification or email that i would be charged.
Jan-25,US Grade 4,Price,"Your cancellation process is garbage. I thought I canceled months ago, but that deceptive final page tricked me into quitting the cancellation process before I was done. For that reason, I will never use your service again and I will encourage others to not use your service either."
Jan-25,sen,Price,I though I had canceled this and realized you make the process so difficult and I have been charged for I don t know how long which is rude for a busy teacher that doesn’t get paid much. I barely used this on the trial. Which you could give me back the 20.00 for the last 2 months.
Jan-25,sen,Price,I'm not using this app but kept on adding credit on my account. I'm not asking for refund but please stop getting credit from my account. Thank you
Jan-25,sen,Price,Nothing on here I havent used this website not even once because the materials suck. But yall take 9.00 out my account for months. Never coming back again.
Jan-25,US Grade 1,Price,I've enjoyed Twinkl for many years and unfortunately I've been dismissed from my educational position.
Jan-25,sen,Price,"Didn't really need this so was cancelling but moved rating to 1 because your unsubscribe process is really shady. That last page for most people looks like they are already done because they've clicked cancel twice and said no to the up-sell. The 3rd attempt on first glance looks like you're done unless you look close and realize it's ANOTHER attempt to keep you subscribed.
 
 Your product's fine, don't be so predatory."
Jan-25,US Grade 2,Price,This is the second time that I have been unintentionally signed up for a membership without any kind of email notification.
Jan-25,US Kindergarten,Price,I have been charged for an entire year and didn't realize I had a membership. Sorry to loose all that money for no benefit.
Jan-25,US Pre K,Price,I attempted to cancel this in November and was surprised to see you charged me again in December and January. Perhaps co sister a cancelation process that doesn’t require 4 screens and lots of scrolling.
Jan-25,ks1,Price,"I would like to request a refund. I didn’t realize I signed up for a recurring subscription and when I attempted to cancel before I guess I didn’t complete the process and now I am realizing it is because there are four pages of prompts to redirect from canceling!
 Can I be refunded? You should be able to see I have not been accessing this account or using content since my original trial."
Jan-25,US Grade 4,Price,I signed up for free resources and had to put my cc info in. Then I forgot that I had to have a subscription and had to delete it before charged. I could honestly make most of these resources on my own for cheaper. I don't like the subscription aspect. I also thought I cancelled last month but evidently didn't get through the entire cancellation procedure. I used this site one time and then forgot all about it.
Jan-25,sen,Price,I don't know why I was charged to much and I am not using this site. I'm very upset because they charged me over $89.00
Jan-25,US Grade 5,Price,Would like refund as i previously tried to cancel right after i did the trial and realized i woukd not use enoughand nota good time to spend money
Jan-25,US Kindergarten,Price,Mkae it easier to cancel. I thought I had canceled once because the MULTIPLE steps to cancel confused me. This resulted in my subscription going longer than i wanted.
Jan-25,US Grade 5,Price,"It might be nice if there was an option for ""few and far between,"" like an ""up to 12 downloads per year"" option that made the membership less expensive. I cannot justify nearly $10/mo for a resource I only use in emergencies."
Jan-25,US Grade 1,Price,"I don't use it enough to justify the monthly subscription. I find ideas, but nothing that I can download and use without recreating it to fit my lessons."
Jan-25,slt,Price,"I never received my planner, even after contacting customer support and getting a confirmation email months ago. I confirmed my email address."
Jan-25,US Grade 2,Price,"I love your resources first off! Layout is great and everything! I have one problem. You bill me almost every other week , more than 3 four times a day and then to make it worse it's all different prices! Ranging from $4-$10. I can send you an email with photo proof if you'd like. That is the only reason I'm cancelling."
Jan-25,US Grade 4,Price,"I love Twinkl! The activities are colorful and creative, but my District is paying for other resources that I have to use. Thank you for helping teachers!"
Jan-25,US Kindergarten,Price,"I’m a single mom, I’m really broke, and I forgot to cancel this before it came out of my gas money for the next two weeks. My tank is on empty and now I don’t know what to do. Right before this charge came out, another charge from weight watchers came out that I also forgot to cancel for $23. So I lost all my gas money, I’m already on e, and I just need to do this now before it happens again next month. I love the website, when I am in a better place I’d love to come back"
Jan-25,US Pre K,Price,"I love having access to so many wonderful teaching tools, it has just become too pricey each month to pay for this personally for my classroom use."
Jan-25,ey,Resource Quality,"We don't market sex to children over here.
 In Germany, Barbie is a sex doll. In America, she is a child's toy."
Jan-25,US Kindergarten,Resource Quality,"Activities for 6 year old children who are learning Portuguese language. The material is very limited, more for older kids and is not interesting."
Jan-25,US Grade 6,Resource Quality,Please add more options for Spanish Language arts or the ease of selecting downloands in Spanish or other languages
Jan-25,US Grade 6,Resource Quality,I'm not finding sufficient work for what I need to homeschool or enhance my child learning. It's too limiting and not enough direct content
Jan-25,US Grade 7,Resource Quality,"Too difficult to manage subscriptions. I see things that interest me, but never get the chance to go back & use for speech therapy materials."
Jan-25,parent,Customer Service,"Very frustrating to see so many attempts at trying to run my card when all I wanted was to end my membership. After one unsuccessful attempt, there should be an easy option to cancel or renew with new card rather continually reattempting a card payment without my permission. This is how most websites work."
Jan-25,US Grade 5,Ease of Website,I was not able to print out any documents and I didn't cancel before my card was charged!! I don't want to be charged again next year for something that I'm not going to use!
Jan-25,US Kindergarten,Ease of Website,Very confusing to navigate - too much at once when searching - organization is slightly confusing without spending a lot of time to try to navigate
Jan-25,adult educator,Price,I signed up to check it out. Very disappointed after checking it out so I cancel the next day. To my surprise you did not cancel my subscription. Why did you not cancel my subscription and refund my money?
Jan-25,ks1,Price,"Please return billed amount 1/1/25, I never authorized the CC charged. I cancel my account today and want refund ASAP!"
Jan-25,parent,Price,I am a stay at home mom and I just wanted materials. I could use occasionally I don’t need to pay for every month because I don’t use it every month just here and there.
Jan-25,US Grade 2,Ease of Website,"I am also teaching high school and I saw those materials. If I ever go back to elementary or even middle school, I might get a membership again."
Jan-25,sen,Price,Canceling is too difficult. i had two accounts for almost a year because i didnt realize it. just annoying
Jan-25,US Grade 2,Variety of Materials,I am not able to incorporate the resources I like from Twinkl enough in my teaching due to curriculum demands to support the cost. I don't think that the cost is unreasonable. I just need to cut it for my budget. Overall it is reasonably priced. I just can't justify paying for it and not being able to use it more frequently. I have been completely pleased with every item I have downloaded and used.
Jan-25,ks3,Ease of Website,J'aimais beaucoup l'abonnement mais financement maintemant c'est difficile. Peut-être je le repondrai dans l'avenir.
Jan-25,sen,Price,looking for a cheaper resource options and currently using TPT as I find exactly what special education resources I need from other special education teachers.
Jan-25,parent,Price,Love & enjoy the site. cant justify paying for as not directly used in my current job or personal life
Jan-25,US Grade 1,Price,I plan to come back. I wish you would do auto renewal. I prefer an option. Money is tight right now. I use the free option until my school give an increase in pay then I can come back.
Jan-25,home ed,Price,"As I have written, your website has been invaluable, but now my grandsons are enrolled in school and we no longer use the site"
Jan-25,US Grade 2,Price,You should email someone before you try to bill for the next year. My credit card company alerted me of an authorized biller and it was your company. An email would have been nice.
Jan-25,sen,Resource Quality,"The resources are not organized well. It's difficult to find materials. The quality ranges from poor to simply ok. Too many resources, no organization!"
Jan-25,ks3,Resource Quality,I like it very much. I would only add more grammar materials for the world languages - middle school/ high school.
Jan-25,home ed,Variety of Materials,The last year price was $49.95 which was reasonable for occasional use. This year price of almost $90 per year is too high for what I use the site’s materials for. Sadly I’ll have to find another way to supplement my kids
Jan-25,sen,Variety of Materials,"I'm no longer working with the population I was, but if I do, I'll be getting another membership to Twinkl!"
